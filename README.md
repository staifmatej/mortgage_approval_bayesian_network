- `ðŸŸ¦ Employment & Demographics` - Age, size of company, highest education, employment type, government employee, len employment.
- `ðŸŸ© Financial Inputs` - average salary, reported monthly income, investment value, property owned value, total existing debt, housing status.
-  `ðŸŸ§ Loan Parameters`  - Loan Amount, Loan Term.
- `ðŸŸª Computed Variables` - mortgage eng age, monthly payment, stability income, total stable income monthly, core net worth, years of mortgage after retirement. 
- `ðŸŸ¨ Risk Ratios` - ratio income debt, ratio debt net worth, ratio income to average salary, ratio payment to income.
- `ðŸŸ¥ Risk Assesment`  - credit histroy, defaulted
- **Final Decision**: The ultimate loan approval decision represented as a probability score (0â€“1), which vraci pravdepodobnost toho ze zadatel o hypoteku ktery zvladne uspesne splatit hypoteku.

## Installation & Usage

- Clone the repository using SSH or HTTPS
    - **SSH:** `git@github.com:staifmatej/mortgage_approval_bayesian_network.git`
    - **HTTPS:** `https://github.com/staifmatej/mortgage_approval_bayesian_network.git`

- Navigate to the project directory (to the root folder)

    - `cd mortgage_approval_bayesian_network`

- Create virtual environment and install dependencies:

    - `python3 -m venv venv`
    - `source venv/bin/activate`
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Run program, test unit tests or check for PEP8 score:
 
    - `python main.py` (to start program)
    - `pytest` (to run unit tests)
    - `pylint . --disable=C0301,C0103` (PEP8 score)

## Testing

To run the tests, execute `pytest` directly in the main project directory (**root folder**).

## Codestyle

To check code style compliance, run `pylint . --disable=C0301,C0103` from the **root folder**.
This will analyze all Python files while ignoring line length (C0301) and naming convention (C0103) warnings.
  

**Note**: These pylint warnings are occasionally suppressed
  directly in the code. I tried to minimize pylint warning
  suppressions, but sometimes I determined that suppression
   was the best choice, as making the changes would not
  help improve my program design skills and would only make
   the program structure more chaotic.
